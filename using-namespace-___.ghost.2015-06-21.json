Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nThere's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n\nThat should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)","html":"<p>You're live! Nice.

Since I prefer to work smarter (not harder), and someone else has already put in the elbow grease, I used an existing automated tool to do this (see:  [Reflector](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Reflector)) The fix for me required the following sequence of commands:\n\nFirst, I had to install Reflector.\n\n```\nsudo pacman -S reflector\n```\n\nMade a backup of my old mirrolist.\n```\nsudo mv /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.bak\n```\n\nAnd finally, reflector filters the first 20 mirrors, sorts by download rate, and saves the result to  `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`.\n```\nsudo reflector --verbose -l 20 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist\n```\n\nThen I tried to update again using `sudo pacman -Syu`.

They have a Linux client that has been in [beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta) for at least a year and a half, and while it may have improved some, it also has some serious unresolved issues that have prevented it from ever working for me. \n\nI'm not sure exactly what the problem is. I do know that their Linux client does not play nicely with [encrypted home directories](https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/ecryptfs.html), so that could be my hurdle. I never tried the slapped-together workarounds... But it could also be any number of other things. The software installs via a shell script, so it can't rely on the distribution's [package manager](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/utopic/man8/apt-get.8.html) to resolve dependencies or handle updates. I assume that PrivateInternetAccess has invested the effort to put together this client at all because they're aiming for \"ease of use\" and wanted a GUI that matched their windows/OSX client. \n\nIf only it worked. For awhile I just didn't bother. I would tether through my phone when I was booted into Linux to avoid having to figure out this stupid VPN networking thing. \n\nAnd then it dawned on me (I'll admit, it took months) that [PIA's iOS solution](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/#ios_openvpn) was basically to point their users to the [official OpenVPN iOS client](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/openvpn-connect/id590379981?mt=8) and provide the relevant configuration and certificate files to get up and running. I already had those files in [Dropbox](https://db.tt/hfGttYJY) and had configured things successfully on my iPad. Now I just needed to figure out how to get a basic OpenVPN client setup working in [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/).\n\nStep 1: Installed [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/). I'm (unfortunately) still running Ubuntu on this computer. If you're running another distribution, you'll have to substitute the appropriate command for your package manager.\n```\nsudo apt-get install openvpn\n```\n\nStep 2: Private Internet Access provides config files for various regions for iOS at http://piavpn.com/ios. I chose `us-east.ovpn` since I'm on the east coast, downloaded/saved it locally, and then moved it to `/etc/openvpn/us-east.conf`. Unfortunately, PIA's ovpn files won't *\"just work\"* with OpenVPN, at least not in my experience. I tried renaming the file and making a single modification to point it to my username/password information, but OpenVPN did not connect to the VPN with the configuration, ca certificate, and CRL key all in the same file like the one provided by PIA. \n\nThat meant parsing out chunks of the .ovpn file into things that would play nicely with OpenVPN. The configuration for the server is at the beginning of the .ovpn file -- with the ca certificate dumped right in the middle. At the end is the CRL verification key. First, I pulled the CRL key out into a new file named `/etc/openvpn/crl.pem` and I copied the ca certificate into `/etc/openvpn/ca.crt`. The `<ca></ca>` and `<crl-verify></crl-verify>` should not be copied and should be deleted from the configuration file. Where the ca certificate used to be, I deleted the `setenv CLIENT_CERT 0` and added `ca ca.crt`. Similarly, `crl-verify crl.pem` got appended to the end.\n\nLastly, I created another new file at `/etc/openvpn/login.info` with my username/password in this format:\n```\nusername\npassword\n```\nThat's it. Just those two lines. Then back in `/etc/openvpn/us-east.conf`, we need to change this line:\n```\nauth-user-pass\n```\nto this:\n```\nauth-user-pass login.info\n```\n\nFor the sake of clarity, after all my editing was completed, here is what's left over in `/etc/openvpn/us-east.conf`:\n```\nclient\ndev tun \nremote us-east.privateinternetaccess.com 1194 udp \nremote us-east.privateinternetaccess.com 53 udp \nremote us-east.privateinternetaccess.com 443 tcp \nresolv-retry infinite\nnobind\npersist-key\npersist-tun\nca ca.crt\ntls-client\nremote-cert-tls server\nauth-user-pass login.info\ncomp-lzo\nverb 1\nreneg-sec 0\ncrl-verify crl.pem\n```\n\nTo the moment of truth. For me, that was all the heavy lifting. `sudo service openvpn start us-east` now successfully connects to my VPN service provided by PIA.\n\nA couple things to note - if you don't want the openvpn service to start automatically, the appropriate command is `sudo update-rc.d openvpn disable`. Of course, to use OpenVPN then you will have to use `sudo service openvpn start us-east` each time you want to start the VPN service. For those less familiar with Linux, note you can substitute `start` in that command with `stop`, `status` or `restart` (among other things) to control the service.\n\nHappy tunneling!","html":"<p>I regularly use a VPN, for a number of different reasons, but <a href=\"https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/\">my VPN service</a>  doesn't have what you would call \"first class\" support for Linux.

For those less familiar with Linux, note you can substitute <code>start</code> in that command with <code>stop</code>, <code>status</code> or <code>restart</code> (among other things) to control the service.</p>\n\n<p>Happy tunneling!</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1427222225938,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1427248703236,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1427248106429,"published_by":1},{"id":5,"uuid":"1596f6dc-70c2-4d20-9914-e9c170f05321","title":"Platform lock-in starts early!","slug":"platform-lock-in-starts-early","markdown":"<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppIeOfflciaI_\">@AppIeOfflciaI_</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/google\">@google</a> - next generation platform war: <a href=\"https://t.co/HShVNpCxzQ\">https://t.co/HShVNpCxzQ</a></p>&mdash; Erik Wichern (@ewichern) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ewichern/status/581129240864780288\">March 26, 2015</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>","html":"<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppIeOfflciaI_\">@AppIeOfflciaI_</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/google\">@google</a> - next generation platform war: <a href=\"https://t.co/HShVNpCxzQ\">https://t.co/HShVNpCxzQ</a></p>&mdash; Erik Wichern (@ewichern) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ewichern/status/581129240864780288\">March 26, 2015</a></blockquote>  \n\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1427390360595,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1427390518564,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1427390466270,"published_by":1},{"id":6,"uuid":"d04be60b-a881-465d-acd8-d7c4afe77850","title":"Let the spam begin","slug":"let-the-spam-begin","markdown":"I added [Disqus](http://disqus.com) comments to the website today.

It's buggy and bloated, and (in my opinion) not even particularly visually appealing.

I don't actually have anything specific against Gnome, but I wanted to yank _everything_ out and see how I liked a \"pure\" Xfce/[GTK+](www.gtk.org/) environment. I admit I'm missing a couple of Gnome's desktop apps and settings managers, but Xfce does a pretty good job overall of exposing configuration options to the user through the GUI.\n\nFinally, before I get into the things that I really liked about my new Xfce environment... Here's a tease -- I _did_ break something and describe that experience at the end.\n\n####Performance\nThis shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone familiar with Linux windows managers, but Xfce/GTK+ is significantly lighter on resources than Unity. After a fresh reboot it saves me a couple hundred megabytes of ram. I'm ashamed to admit I'm typing this booted into Windows, but because I like to provide evidence for claims, I'll fire up a [VM](https://www.virtualbox.org/)... for Science!\n\nI can't boot up my Unity desktop now, so you'll have to take my word that I relatively recently was checking memory usage after fresh boots (more out of curiosity and comparison to Windows than anticipation of swapping window managers) and recall my usage pre-Xfce being just shy of 600MB after a reboot. My current usage, running Xfce after a fresh boot is a little under 400MB. That, in my eyes, is a pretty significant difference. I mean, even with my usual paltry 8GB of ram, 200MB is only 2.6% of my total memory, so maybe it's no big deal on my primary two computers. But I also occasionally plug this Linux thumbdrive in to a work computer with only 4GB of ram, or run it as a VM with anywhere from 1-4GB of ram, so 200MB could be 5%, or up to even 20% of my total memory sometimes.\n\nI will acknowledge right now that this number *may* not be an absolutely fair portrayal of Unity, since it was not anything close to a fresh install of Ubuntu (maybe 12-18months old at this point) and has likely acquired some cruft. However, everything has consistently been kept up-to-date with (mostly) official packages, and Xfce is still running on top of that same crufty installation, just minus the Unity and Gnome (plus supporting) packages. \n\nI'll also add some subjective observations -- Xfce seems to load more quickly (I haven't timed it though), and feels much more responsive to user interactions.\n\n####Fonts\nHaving fine-grained control over font selection and anti-aliasing makes a spectacular difference when it comes to an operating system (or any software) appearing polished and providing a pleasant user experience. It's possible that while I was using Unity I never found the right settings window, or the right combination of compositor, fonts, and font aliasing settings to make things look pretty. \n\nBut now things are different, and I can't believe I tolerated that shitty, blurry interface for so long.\n\n####Icons and Themes\nIt was relatively easy to install new sets of icons and themes for Xfce. I know that Xfce is not unique in this regard among Linux window managers, and that you can also install new themes and icons for Unity. However, in my opinion, Unity continues to look like Unity -- just with new colors and icons. In my experience, there are some elements that can't be modified, moved, or hidden, so unless you want to remove the functionality altogether, you're stuck with something that still looks like Unity.\n\nXfce, on the other hand, specifies few limits on how the user can customize \"panels\" (for the uninitiated, think Windows taskbar). You can add, remove, or even duplicate components in an infinite number of configurations. You can have multiple panels, with different plugins on different panels, or maybe an identical second panel on a dual monitor setup. And did I mention that these panels nicely conform to the same theme as everything else? Or they could be different -- if you want that *My Little Pony* screencap as your panel background, there's nothing stopping you!\n\nThe actual \"window manager\" portion of Xfce gets similar treatment. Colors, buttons, handles -- everything can be changed and themed. \n\nIt all looks very, very slick when put together with a nice theme and icon set (and good fonts with the right aliasing settings), and has allowed me to poke around until I've got a desktop user interface that I'm actually (more or less) happy with. This all seems like an evolution of my tendency towards endless tinkering on my [World of Warcraft](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com) UI.  \n\n####Not all roses\nXfce has it's quirks too -- like why bother with an `Appearance` settings dialog if the appearance settings are _actually_ going to be scattered in at least 3-4 different places. I see the ability modify the visual appearance of Xfce in `Appearance`, `Desktop`, `Panel`, `Screensaver`, `Window Manager`, and `Window Manager Tweaks` (Compositor settings). Don't get me wrong -- I _like_ the fact that Xfce (and Linux in general) is modular. I understand that these components and their accompanying settings dialogs may stand alone from each other, which may also justify a sometimes-awkward organization of configuration elements. But I can also acknowledge that it could be better.\n\n####The ugly\nIn the process of ripping out Unity, Gnome, and all of their required/recommended packages, I also (unintentionally) removed my [display manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_display_manager_%28program_type%29)(DM) and [greeter/login](https://launchpad.net/unity-greeter) screen. \n\nNow technically it's not necessary to have a DM. I could just boot to the command line, log in, run `startx` and go from there (see [here](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/XWindow-User-HOWTO/cli.html) and [here](http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/getting-started#getting_started) for background and instructions). Still, even for a guy like me who loves his CLI, having a nice GUI login and the desktop environment fire up automatically is just a matter of efficiency.\n\nSo there I was, no DM, no way to graphically log in. Just a big fat error message. `Ctrl+Alt+F1` to the rescue... took a few minutes to make sure I had [LightDM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightDM) and dependencies all installed (I can't remember if I had to actually re-install anything there or not), and then another quick `sudo apt-get install`  and I grabbed the Webkit greeter for a lightweight Gnome-free graphical login. No specific reson for Webkit -- it was just the first one I stumbled across that was clear of the dependencies I wanted to avoid, and looked lightweight, so it got installed.\n\nConclusion\n---\nI like Xfce. I will probably continue to use it in the future -- or at the very least I will probably never install a Unity desktop again. I might try playing around with [Manjaro](https://manjaro.github.io/) or [Xubuntu](xubuntu.org/) in a VM and maybe wipe/reinstall my thumbdrive (hell, maybe install to a permanent partition on my laptop) if I actually like one of them.

Like tonight, when my wifi didn't automatically connect... I recently upgraded my [LG G2](www.lg.com/us/mobile-phones/g2) to [Lollipop](https://www.android.com/intl/en_us/versions/lollipop-5-0/) (5.0.2 is all I got, but I'll take anything for a 2013 phone), and in the process my hotspot information got reset. So (unsurprisingly) the saved network information that linux has been using to automagically connect to wifi doesn't work for that hotspot anymore. I've been using the ethernet jack recently, so hadn't noticed or needed to fix it, but tonight I didn't feel like plugging in... which was a problem.\n\nI went poking around the Whisker menu for a network configuration manager -- and find nothing. It began to dawn on me that I may not have one installed at all if Xfce didn't come with one by default (it does not). Shit. So, I fell back on the rallying cry of linux geeks everywhere, \"to the command line!\"\n\nObviously (and annoyingly), I also couldn't look anything up (besides linux [man pages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page)) on the laptop itself, so I was poking around on my phone while I attempted to figure out exactly which command line utility would allow me to reconfigure my wifi network. In the end, the internet actually wasn't even very helpful, and it *was* the man pages after all that held the solution to my problem. After peeling back some layers (`ifconfig -> iwconfig -> nm-tool -> NetworkManager`) I finally stumbled upon the `nmcli` utility which allowed me to modify my wifi configuration from the command line.\n\nThe command that did the trick was:\n`nmcli dev wifi connect 'insert-SSID' password 'insert-WPA-key' wep-key-type key`\n\nAnyone who wants to investigate further can find read more detail by typing (on a linux system) `man nmcli` and then `\\wifi connect` (man pages use many [vim-style commands](http://tnerual.eriogerg.free.fr/vimqrc.html), e.g. backslash to search). Or find a copy of the man page here: http://linux.die.net/man/1/nmcli\n\nIn my case the wifi hardware was recognized, had a driver installed, and was enabled. It just didn't have the right information to authenticate to the hotspot, and no GUI to notify me or allow easy input/modification. So nothing too difficult to fix this time -- I have *horror* stories about drivers for network adaptors, both wired and wireless, but thankfully linux network drivers have matured quite a bit over the last 10-15 years.\n\nThe lesson here is to not indescriminately `apt-get remove` every trace of gnome from a linux computer! At least not without carefully considering all the places you don't think about where a distro is using little gnome apps...

So, I fell back on the rallying cry of linux geeks everywhere, \"to the command line!\"</p>\n\n<p>Obviously (and annoyingly), I also couldn't look anything up (besides linux <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page\">man pages</a>) on the laptop itself, so I was poking around on my phone while I attempted to figure out exactly which command line utility would allow me to reconfigure my wifi network. In the end, the internet actually wasn't even very helpful, and it <em>was</em> the man pages after all that held the solution to my problem. After peeling back some layers (<code>ifconfig -&gt; iwconfig -&gt; nm-tool -&gt; NetworkManager</code>) I finally stumbled upon the <code>nmcli</code> utility which allowed me to modify my wifi configuration from the command line.</p>\n\n<p>The command that did the trick was: <br />\n<code>nmcli dev wifi connect 'insert-SSID' password 'insert-WPA-key' wep-key-type key</code></p>\n\n<p>Anyone who wants to investigate further can find read more detail by typing (on a linux system) <code>man nmcli</code> and then <code>\\wifi connect</code> (man pages use many <a href=\"http://tnerual.eriogerg.free.fr/vimqrc.html\">vim-style commands</a>, e.g. backslash to search). Or find a copy of the man page here: <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/1/nmcli\">http://linux.die.net/man/1/nmcli</a></p>\n\n<p>In my case the wifi hardware was recognized, had a driver installed, and was enabled. It just didn't have the right information to authenticate to the hotspot, and no GUI to notify me or allow easy input/modification. So nothing too difficult to fix this time -- I have <em>horror</em> stories about drivers for network adaptors, both wired and wireless, but thankfully linux network drivers have matured quite a bit over the last 10-15 years.</p>\n\n<p>The lesson here is to not indescriminately <code>apt-get remove</code> every trace of gnome from a linux computer! At least not without carefully considering all the places you don't think about where a distro is using little gnome apps... </p>","image":"/content/images/2015/05/vim.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1431331065269,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1431333293297,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1431333241993,"published_by":1},{"id":10,"uuid":"50c6631d-e0b6-4cc7-be71-8dc617ee268e","title":"Sometimes proprietary software is better","slug":"sometimes-proprietary-software-is-better","markdown":"#### The situation\nI've been working on my [résumé](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/99151/ErikWichernResume.pdf) as I work on my career transition into software development. I already (in the last several months) have put together something decent-looking -- especially in comparison to the 5-year-old abomination that was my original source material. However, I wanted to kick it up another notch and add some additional focus and visual appeal to the document. Of course, whether the end result succeeds or not may be up for debate, but that's not what this blog post is about.\n\n#### LibreOffice is good at most things...\nThis blog post is about [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org) (or [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/) if you're still using things from 2010). LibreOffice is great. It's [free (speech + beer)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre), implements [standards-based document formats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument), and generally does most of the *essential* things you might want from an office suite. Note my emphasis there. \n\nWhat LibreOffice does not do very well are lots of fancy things that [Microsoft Office](https://products.office.com/en-US/) has been doing for 10+ years. Two examples:\n\n* embedding audio files in powerpoint presentations - I've needed to do this for several classes during my academic career, and tried to find a (not-completely-shitty) way to do it in LibreOffice. I could not find a suitable method and ended up paying for an Office365[^n] subscription.\n* Trying to create a colored background for the header of my résumé. This should not be a hard thing to do. \n\t* Word will let you change page backgrounds and header backgrounds -- though header backgrounds don't go flush to page edges in Word either. However, it's much easier in Word (and functions as expected) to just create a text box with a background color and drag its borders to the edges of the page.\n    * The same effect in LibreOffice requires creating a frame object and modifying a bunch of properties so that it properly extends to all the edges of the page, and then creating a table inside of the frame so that the margins match the rest of the page... So it's possible, it's just a pain in the ass.\n* Something so simple as a horizontal rule... In Word you just insert and then choose a style for the line. In LibreOffice the best \"solution\" for this scenario requires that I futz around with paragraph styles on a block of whitespace and have to use a \"border\" element to create a decent looking line.\n\n#### Conclusion\n* The first takeaway is that ideological positions get tossed to the wind when I have an looming project deadline and the tools I have to work with aren't cutting it. Then I just need shit to work and as long as the tool wasn't built by children in [sweatshops in Malaysia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoolander#Censorship), I'm probably ethically comfortable with my choice.\n* I would prefer if I could have a union of \"all the things I need working all the time\" and \"this aligns with my ideological beliefs\", and as an adult who is not broke, am possibly willing to pay for products that satisfy these criteria. Disclosure: I have not donated to the [The Document Foundation](https://www.documentfoundation.org/), so it's possible I'm part of the problem and if they had more money their \"product\" would meet my needs better. Chicken or the egg problem? `vOv` Doesn't really matter, because I use Google Docs/Drive 90% of the time anyways, and I'm not particularly inclined to donate when LibreOffice is 50% frustration when I do need to use it for anything beyond the most basic document editing.\n* And finally, now that I'm more comfortable with Java, ranty posts like this make me feel like I should go take a look at the LibreOffice issues tracker and see if I can help out...[^n] \n\n######Notes\n[^n]: I got a month free the first time I needed MS Office (some promotion/trial), and then the second time I needed it, I just shelled out the $70-80 for a 4-year academic license. $20/year isn't worth my time to troll around for hack solutions to LibreOffice shortcomings.\n[^n]: This is going to be my life from now on, isn't it? I don't just get to be an annoying user who complains about software.
